    <p>Lossy compression is the technique of reducing the file size of an image by removing (losing) information. It is
        a central aspect of the digital world and affects not only images but any piece of data that needs to be stored
        or transmitted. As Lev Manovich points out, this notion of loss seems to undermine the image of the “perfect
        world of the digital.” Intentionally losing information runs counter to the ideal of precision which is central
        to both the digital world and to architecture. The job of the architect, as described from Alberti onward, is to
        define the building through drawing so that it can be precisely constructed on site. A process of loss along the
        way is less than ideal, but it is a central part of the digital culture of which architecture is a part. It is
        also an intrinsic, but often times unmentioned, aspect of architectural method. Even Henri Poincaré’s ideal
        circle is manifested as only a “round thing” once it translated into physical space—leaving both the designer’s
        intent and authorship muddled with the technologies of fabrication. This semester we will study and engage the
        inherent lossiness in architecture as means of questioning the relationship between authorship and the
        transmission of ideas through architectural methods and computational media..</p>
